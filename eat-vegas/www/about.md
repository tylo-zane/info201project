# Eat Vegas

## Project Purpose: 
To provide a restaurant visualization for tourists in Las Vegas looking for neighborhoods with large clusters of good restaurants. 


## Context: 
3 million people come to Las Vegas every month in search of a perfect break. To their journey, an enjoyable dining experience concludes their day and makes the trip truly memorable. Yet spending time scrolling for a restaurant in the middle of having fun can disturb their mood and relaxing experience. Eat Vegas makes it easy by allowing tourists to discover food by genre and region and find what Vegas has to offer in a restaurant visualization map. With satisfying dinners planned out, we hope to give people a more relaxing travel experience in Las Vegas.
